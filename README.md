Three-dimensional (3D) visualization involves feature extraction and 3D reconstruction of CT images using a computer processing technology. It is a tool for displaying, describing, and interpreting 3D anatomy and morphological features of organs, thus providing intuitive, stereoscopic, and accurate methods for clinical decision-making. It has played an increasingly significant role in the diagnosis and management of liver diseases. Researchers faces more challenging task in healthcare sectors to predict the diseases from the voluminous medical databases. Nowadays data mining became more essential in healthcare sectors. The main objective of this system is to predict liver diseases using classification algorithms. The algorithms used in this work are 3D CNN and 3d UNET.These classifier algorithms are compared based on the performance factors i.e. classification accuracy and execution time. Then, we can implement the web framework such as streamlit.
